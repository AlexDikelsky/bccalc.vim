*bccalc.txt* translations for |bc|

INTRODUCTION					*bccalc*

This plugin makes it simple to evaluate the current line or visual selection
in |bc|. This is forked from https://github.com/timcharper/bccalc.vim, and
has some major differences. Instead of treating equal signs as chained equations, 
they are treated as assignment operators. Also, superscripts such as ² are 
interprated as ^(2)

MAPPINGS					*bccalc-mappings*

						*<leader>bc*
<leader>bc  Evaluate the current line or visual selection as a |bc| expression.
	    Superscript characters such as ² will be translated to ^(2), and
	    functions such as log(x) or cos(c) will be translated to their |bc|
	    equivalents. The output will be echoed and copied into the unnamed 
	    register.
